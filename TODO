The plan, as of 6 September 2005

* Literature indexing:
  Support for Abiword and OpenOffice

* Custom bibtex fields:
  Enable user defined custom fields
  User should be able to associate fields with record types
  (eg. custom notes, abstracts, reviews etc...)

* Drag and drop support:
  Be able to drag from list view and drop a reference into a text file

* Word processor integration:
  Investigate intergration with Lyx, Abiword, OpenOffice, MS-Word (Win port)

* Online literature searches:
  Search online literature databases, eg. Medline, ScienceDirect etc...
  Automatic downloading of results?

* Fix paste BibTeX from clipboard functionality

* Store some general stuff (options, history etc) in ~/.bibliographer

* When loading an average sized .bib that has many URI associations with its
  entries, there's a big delay as thumbnails are computed -- this is because
  these are done on the GUI thread (running on a background thread was causing
  crashes). It would be good to find a way of backgrounding this, but also
  would be good to have a cache in ~/.bibliographer that uses URI and MD5 as
  indices.

* Mangling and demangling of special characters (accents, umlauts etc)

* Get the win32 port actually working :-)
